# Demystification of Stock Brokering: A Deep Convolutional Neural NetworkApproach For Stock Market Prediction
Stock also known as ‘equity’ or ‘shares’ is a type of security that signifies ownership in a corporation and represents a claim on part of the corporation’s assets and earnings whereas a stock market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks. A stock exchange is an exchange where stock brokers and traders can buy and sell shares of stock, bonds, and other securities. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. Such type of an exchange deals with concentration and a focused mind as the entire process is dealing with valuable assets of a person.
          Thus to ease the process of stock exchange many stock brokers use the act of stock market predication i.e. trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instruments traded for exchange. Predication is done by fundamental analysis and technical analysis and also using machine learning which the main focus of our project.
